StateBuilderDotNet
============

*StateBuilderDotNet* is a C# state machine code generator.

From an XML state machine description file, *StateBuilderDotNet* produces a C# source code implementation using an extended version of the state pattern.

The XML state machine description can be authored with the [web based state diagram editor](http://www.stateforge.com/StateMachineDiagram/StateMachineDiagram.html)
